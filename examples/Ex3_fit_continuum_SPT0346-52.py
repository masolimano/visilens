"""
This is a new continuum fitting Example 3 compared to what
used to be up here on github. I swapped out the old one for
this one because this one probably represents a more typical
case for most people, and it's a somewhat simpler system
to model, so the chains converge faster. For reference, I can
run this script on a late-2013 MacBook Pro in ~2 hours.

Example 3, to be run in python. This script fits to some 2mm 
continuum data (140GHz, to be more precise) of SPT0346-52 at
z = 5.656. The primary target of these observations was the
CO(8-7) line, which was detected at high significance. Later on,
in Example 5, I'll show how to do a joint fit to the line and
the continuum.

Here, we model the field using a standard SIE lens with external
tidal shear, which lenses the Sersic profile of emission.

In this case, we actually don't have a spectroscopic redshift for
the lens, but the magnification and source angular size don't 
actually depend on this; only the lens mass changes.

# These set how we set up the field. In this case, we'll model

# ie, between -2.5" and +1.5" in x and -2.0" and +2.0" in y. We
# simulate this region at higher resolution, in this case 0.025".
# The full field is simulated at 0.05". NOTE: the field grid size
# goes to the next-higher power of 2, so fieldres is a coarse limit
# to the actual resolution. In this case, the true resolution will
# be 25/512 = 0.0488", because the grid we asked for gets rounded up
# to 512. Using large grids makes the code take MUCH longer, so I
# strongly recommend choosing the field size and resolution carefully;

# Okay, now onto some interferometric wizardry. If your data were
# observed multiple times (eg, multiple executions on ALMA), you
# may need to allow for some variation between the executions in the
# absolute flux scaling of the data and a difference in the 
# astrometry. For example, ALMA claims that the absolute flux scale
# on its data is good to ~<10%, but you can easily have data that
# is more constraining than that; similarly, I've seen data with
# astrometric accuracty good to ~0.2", but the data can constrain
# the lens position far better than this. These data were only observed
# once, so we'll set them to False, but you might need this for
# your data (feel free to email me for help).
scaleamp =   False # do not allow flux re-scaling

# There's also the possibility that the data have antenna-based
# phase errors which could bias our model results. These could
# be due to imperfectly known antenna positions, or the fact that
# the observations were too short to allow atmospheric variations
# to average over the array. This is sort of like self-calibrating
# your data, except that in this case, we use a model of the field
# generated from the lensing geometry instead of from CLEAN
# components. This lets us marginalize over those phase errors, but
# you can also use this to identify possibly-bad antennas to remove.
# So, DO NOT self-cal your data beforehand! The math behind this
# technique is described in the appendix to Hezaveh et al. (2013),
